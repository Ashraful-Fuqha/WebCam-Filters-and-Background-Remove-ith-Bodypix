**Project Title**:
# Real-time Webcam Effects and Background Manipulation using BodyPix

**Project Description**:
In this project, I've single-handedly developed a real-time webcam background manipulation application using JavaScript and TensorFlow.js' BodyPix model. The journey of building this application from scratch was filled with learning and problem-solving. It required a deep understanding of TensorFlow.js, BodyPix, and real-time video processing techniques.

The application allows users to apply various effects to the webcam feed in real-time, providing an interactive and engaging experience. The development process involved numerous iterations of designing, coding, testing, and refining the application to ensure a seamless user experience.

**Key Features**:
1. **Background Removal**: The application uses BodyPix to segment the person from the webcam feed and removes the background of the person.
2. **Color Filters**: The application includes several color filters, such as RGB and Red, that users can apply to the webcam feed for a unique look.
3. **Green Screen Effect**: Users can apply a green screen effect to the webcam feed, allowing for easy background replacement in post-processing.(Under Development)
4. **Recording and Snapshot**: The application allows users to record their webcam feed with the applied effects and take snapshots, which can be saved and shared.

**Efforts**:
The project was a significant undertaking that required a considerable amount of effort. From understanding the BodyPix model to implementing real-time video effects, each step presented its own challenges. Despite these challenges, I was able to successfully complete the project single-handedly, gaining valuable experience and skills along the way.

**Future Work**:
I plan to continue improving the application by adding more effects and features, optimizing performance, and enhancing the user interface.
